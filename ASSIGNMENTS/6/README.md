#Assignment 6

``ASSIGNMENTS/4/soln`` code is a full-stack (server +
webapp) that allows you to maintain a list of online images. Each image
has a URL, title and optional description. 

Instead of taking user input (for image URLs) get the user to upload
images (see ``s3Eg/``).

You need to integrate
[Darkroom.js](https://github.com/MattKetmo/darkroomjs), so that each
image can be edited.

## Submisssion

Email me the IP address as URL (again). e.g if your server IP was 12.56.134.53,
then my submission URL would be **http://12.56.134.53/index.html**
